# 🔍 Dataset Deduplication

## Issue Discovered

The NASA KOI dataset contains **duplicate rows** for the same objects:
- **Original dataset**: 59,316 rows
- **Unique KOIs**: 9,564 unique (kepid, kepoi_name) pairs
- **Duplicates**: 49,752 duplicate rows (83.9% of dataset!)
- **Average duplicates per KOI**: 6.2x

## Why Duplicates Exist

Each KOI appears multiple times because the NASA Exoplanet Archive includes data from different:
- Data releases (Q1-Q6, Q1-Q8, Q1-Q16, Q1-Q17 DR24, Q1-Q17 DR25)
- Reference sources (different studies and publications)
- Stellar parameter catalogs (TICv8, etc.)

### Example
**K00889.01** (kepid=757450) appears **18 times** with different references:
- Batalha et al. 2013
- TICv8 (TESS Input Catalog)
- Q1-Q17 DR24 KOI Table
- Q1-Q17 DR25 KOI Table
- etc.

## Solution Implemented

### API Update (`api.py`)

```python
# Remove duplicates - keep only first occurrence
df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['kepid', 'kepoi_name'], keep='first')
```

**Strategy**: `keep='first'`
- Keeps the first occurrence of each KOI
- Removes all subsequent duplicates
- Ensures kepid uniqueness for index-based lookups

## Benefits

### 1. **Reduced Dataset Size**
- From: 59,316 rows → To: 9,564 rows
- Reduction: 83.9%
- Memory saved: ~84%

### 2. **Faster Performance**
- Fewer rows to process during predictions
- Faster DataFrame operations
- Quicker API responses

### 3. **Unique kepid Values**
- Critical for index-based lookups: `df.loc[kepid]`
- Prevents ambiguous results
- Ensures deterministic behavior

### 4. **Consistent Results**
- Same KOI always returns same result
- No confusion from multiple entries
- Clearer for API consumers

## Startup Output

After the fix, API startup shows:
```
📊 Loaded data: 59316 rows
🔧 Removed 49752 duplicate rows (kept first occurrence)
   Unique KOIs: 9564
```

## Impact on Predictions

Before:
```
🔮 Predicting dispositions for 59316 KOIs...
   (predicting same KOI 6 times on average)
```

After:
```
🔮 Predicting dispositions for 9564 KOIs...
   (each KOI predicted once)
```

**Prediction time**: Reduced by ~84% ⚡

## API Response Changes

### Before Deduplication
- `/planets` could return duplicate KOIs
- Total count: 59,316
- Inconsistent results based on which duplicate was selected

### After Deduplication
- `/planets` returns unique KOIs only
- Total count: 9,564
- Consistent, deterministic results

## Verification

Run the verification script to see the analysis:
```bash
python verify_duplicates.py
```

## Notes

- The `keep='first'` strategy keeps the first occurrence in the CSV
- Other strategies: `keep='last'` or `keep=False` (remove all duplicates)
- `'first'` is most appropriate as it represents the earliest/original entry

## Data Integrity

The deduplication:
✅ Preserves all unique KOIs (9,564)
✅ Maintains data quality (uses first/primary entry)
✅ Ensures kepid uniqueness
✅ Improves API performance significantly

**Result**: Clean, efficient dataset with unique KOI entries! 🎯
