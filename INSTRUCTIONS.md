## 🔍 Interpreting Results

### Good Signs ✅
- CV mean close to test accuracy (±2%)
- Low CV standard deviation (<0.02)
- Balanced precision/recall across classes
- High confidence predictions (>0.8)

### Warning Signs ⚠️
- Test accuracy >> CV mean (data leakage)
- Test accuracy << CV mean (overfitting)
- High variance in CV scores (instability)
- Poor performance on one class (imbalance issue)

### What to Check
1. **Confusion Matrix**: Which classes are confused?
2. **Feature Importance**: Are top features making sense?
3. **Class Distribution**: Are predictions balanced?
4. **Confidence Scores**: Are predictions confident?

## 💡 Competition Tips

### 1. Understand Your Metric
- Is it accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC, or something else?
- Optimize decision thresholds for your metric
- Different metrics need different strategies

### 2. Feature Engineering is King
- Domain knowledge helps tremendously
- Read about exoplanet detection methods
- Create physically meaningful features
- Test features one by one

### 3. Validation Strategy
- Use same CV strategy as test set
- If test set is temporal, use time-based CV
- Monitor for overfitting constantly

### 4. Ensemble Everything
- Combine multiple models
- Different models capture different patterns
- Simple averaging often works well

### 5. Optimize Thresholds
- Default 0.5 threshold is rarely optimal
- Optimize per-class thresholds
- Use validation set to find best thresholds

### 6. Use All Your Data
- For final submission, retrain on train+val+test
- Only do this at the very end
- Keep a small holdout for sanity check

### 7. Learn from Others
- Study Kaggle solutions for similar problems
- Read papers on exoplanet classification
- Check NASA's ExoMiner approach

## 🛠️ Customization Points

If you need to modify the code:

### Change Data Path
In `train_koi_disposition.py`, line ~30:
```python
CONFIG = {
    'data_path': 'data/koi_with_relative_location.csv',  # Change this
    ...
}
```

### Modify Train/Test Split
In `train_koi_disposition.py`, line ~32-33:
```python
CONFIG = {
    ...
    'test_size': 0.2,  # Change to 0.1, 0.25, etc.
    'val_size': 0.1,   # Change validation size
    ...
}
```

### Tune Hyperparameters
In `train_koi_disposition.py`, search for `xgb_params` (around line 230):
```python
xgb_params = {
    'max_depth': 6,           # Try 4, 8, 10
    'learning_rate': 0.05,    # Try 0.01, 0.1, 0.2
    'n_estimators': 500,      # Try 300, 1000
    ...
}
```

### Add New Features
In `train_koi_disposition.py`, modify the `preprocess_data()` method to add feature engineering steps.
